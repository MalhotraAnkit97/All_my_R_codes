## **Question 1 [60pt] Visualization of the `mpg` data set**

This data set contains fuel economy data 1999 - 2008 for 38 popular car models (source: EPA [http://fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov)).

```{r, collapse=T}
?mpg
dim(mpg)  # dimension of the table
names(mpg)  # list the variables in mpg
str(mpg)  # list the structures in mpg
glimpse(mpg) # get a glimpse of the mpg data
```

### (a) [10pt] Aesthetic mapping of `color`

(i) What's gone wrong with the following code? Why are the points not blue?

```{r, collapse=T}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

The points are not blue as "aes" is used to map variables, that's why it is not changing

```{r, collapse=T, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue")
```



Modify the code to plot blue points.

**INSERT_YOUR_ANSWER**

```{r, collapse=T}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

(ii) What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`? Note, you'll also need to specify x and y.

As shown in the code below, when we add a parameter of 'displ < 5', It categorizes the plot into 2 portions, one for values of displ less than 5, and assigns it to a different color, and another for displ more than 5 and assigns it to a different color. In this scenario, displ < 5 is blue, and more than that is red.

```{r, collapse=T}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = displ < 5))
```


### (b) [20pt] Reproduce the following plots

When generating the plots, focus on the aesthetic mappings in the reference plot. It is OK if the text font size or point size in your plot look different from the reference plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 4) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(alpha = drv), se = FALSE, legend.text = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy, col = drv)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(col = drv), se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(col = drv), size = 5) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x=displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(size = 5, mapping = aes(col = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE)
```



### (c) [10pt] Facets

There are two ways to add additional variable(s) to a 2D plot. One is using aesthetics, the other one is using facets.

(i) Make a scatter plot that x-axis is `displ` and y-axis is `hwy`. Use different colors to distinguish `drv` types.

**INSERT_YOUR_ANSWER**
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(drv))) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ .)
```

(ii) Facet `drv` into the rows. That is, make several **rows** of subplots, one row for each `drv` type. Each subplot has `displ` mapped to the x-axis and `hwy` mapped to the y-axis. **Hint**: Use `nrow` or `ncol` to control the layout of the individual panels.

**INSERT_YOUR_ANSWER** 

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .) 
```



### (d) [10pt] `stat` functions

Most `geom` functions and `stat` functions come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. 

- every `geom` has a default `stat`
- every `stat` has a default `geom` 

Look up the default `stat` functions for the `geom` functions listed in the following table. Also, find out the variables computed by the default `stat` function (See the **Computed variables** section in the documentation page).

**INSERT_YOUR_ANSWER (in the table)**

| `geom` function  | default `stat` function  | variables computed by the default `stat` function  
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| `geom_bar()`        |  stat_count()    |   count         
| `geom_histogram()`  |  stat_bin()      |   count, density, ncount, ndensity          
| `geom_density()`    |  stat_density()  |   x, y, scaled, density         
| `geom_point()`      |  stat_identity() |   x, y, size, colour, shape, alpha
| `geom_smooth()`     |  stat_smooth()   |   Computed based on the smoothing method used

Some `geom` function has stat = "identity" as the default. What does that mean?

The stat = "identity" argument in ggplot2 is used to specify that the heights of the bars or the values of the points should represent the actual data values, rather than being automatically calculated. 
When stat = "identity" is used, it means that the data is not modified or summarized in any way, and the plot should directly represent the provided data values

**Notes**: Table formatting are sometimes tricky using R Markdown. [Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) is a handy tool if you need to make tables in the future.


### (e) [10pt] Position adjustment options for `geom_bar()`

Choose two categorical variables from the `mpg` data set and use them to illustrate the following four position adjustment options for `geom_bar()`:

- **default**: position = "stack"
- position = "identity" will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. 
- position = "fill" works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. 
- position = "dodge" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. 
the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of cut and clarity.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = mpg)
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, fill = fl))
```
```{r}
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, fill = fl), position = "stack")
```

```{r}
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, fill = fl), position = "identity")
```

```{r}
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, fill = fl), position = "fill")
```

```{r}
p + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = class, fill = fl), position = "dodge")
```


Which position option do you like most? What conclusions can you draw from your plot?

My favorite position would be **Dodge** as this gives me all the data points i want to know about each variable i have considered. I can look at multiple variables, and their combination with each other, with different colors & width

From the plot, the conclusions I have drawn are as follows : 
1. r-fuel type SUV has the highest count ,followed by r fuel type of pickup vans/cars (class)
2. Majority of cars are of fueltype r, followed by p-type fuel cars.
3. fuel type c has the lowest number of cars in general.
4. We can also see that subcompact class of cars covers all types of fueltypes, whereas 2seater covers the least, having just one type of fueltype.

## **Question 2 [40pt] Visualization the `quakes` data set**
Recall that the `quakes` data set contain the locations of 1000 seismic events of MB > 4.0. The events occurred in a cube near Fiji since 1964.

```{r}
library(datasets)
?quakes 
```

```{r, collapse=T}
class(quakes)
head(quakes, n=5) # print first 5 rows of quakes
dim(quakes)  # dimension of the table
names(quakes)  # list the variables in quakes
str(quakes)  # list the structures in quakes
glimpse(quakes) # get a glimpse of the quakes data
```

### (a) [30pt] Re-plotting the distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

In Homework 1, Question 1(a), you've plotted the distribution of the earthquake magnitudes using R base graphics. 
This week, write your own `ggplot2` code to reproduce the following four subfigures in a 2-by-2 layout.  

- subfigure #1: plot a density histogram of the earthquake magnitudes, and then plot the estimated probability density curve in red color in the same plot
- subfigure #2: plot a horizontal boxplot of the earthquake magnitudes
- subfigure #3: plot the empirical cdf of the earthquake magnitudes
- subfigure #4: make a Q-Q plot to compare the observed earthquake magnitudes distribution with the Normal distribution. Add a *thick* Q-Q line in blue color.  

**Hints**: 

- In the lecture notes, we used the `grid.arrange()` function from the `gridExtra` package (see [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html)) to layout multiple plots in a single figure. For alternative options, please refer to [this post](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html). 
- Check out [the `geom_histogram()` function](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html) for plotting the **density** histogram.
- Check out [the `stat_ecdf()` function](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/stat_ecdf.html) for plotting the empirical distribution.
- Check out [the `stat_qq()` and `stat_qq_line()` functions](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_qq.html) for plotting the Q-Q plot and Q-Q line.

**INSERT_YOUR_ANSWER**
```{r}
##plot_inf <- ggplot(data = quakes, mapping = aes(x = mag))
##plot_inf + geom_histogram()
library(gridExtra)

p1 <- ggplot(data = quakes, aes(x = mag)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), binwidth = 0.1, color="black", fill="white") +
  geom_density(color = "red", size = 1) 

# Subfigure 2: Horizontal boxplot
p2 <- ggplot(data = quakes, aes(x = mag)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Subfigure 3: Empirical CDF
p3 <- ggplot(data = quakes, aes(x = mag)) +
  stat_ecdf()

# Subfigure 4: Q-Q plot
p4 <- ggplot(data = quakes, aes(sample = mag)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(color = "blue", size = 1.5)

grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,p4, ncol=2)

```


### (b) [10pt] Earthquake location map

Make a scatter plot of the earthquake locations. Use `long` as the x-axis and `lat` as the y-axis. Map `mag` to the size aesthetic and `depth` to the color aesthetic.

```{r}
ggplot(data = quakes, mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(size = mag, color = depth), title = "Scatter Plot of Earthquake")
```


[**Extra credit 20pt**] If you can plot earthquakes point on top of a map layer, you will earn extra points!

```{r}
library(maps)
world_map <- map_data("world")

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = world_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "black") + 
  geom_point(data = quakes, aes(x = long, y = lat, size = mag, color = depth))

```
