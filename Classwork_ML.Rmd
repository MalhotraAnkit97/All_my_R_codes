```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(ggplot2)

plot1 <- ggplot(data = advertising, aes(x = TV, y = sales)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")


plot2 <- ggplot(data = advertising, aes(x = radio, y = sales)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")


plot3 <- ggplot(data = advertising, aes(x = newspaper, y = sales)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, ncol = 3)

```

factors for good predictor models : -

1. Generalizability
2. Bias-Variance tradeoff
3. interpretability-Flexibility
4. Feature Engineering


Is there synergy among the advertising media?

Linear regression only holds for a particular range.

For example, if we have a data comparing marketing budget and sales, increasing marketing budget may not always mean an increase in sales / profit. If the market becomes saturated, then increasing the marketing budget will actually not mean a constant increase because the product is now exhausted or saturated.

If there is no relationship b/w the predictor variables, then should the multiple R^2 be equal to 0?

IMP **

There are 2^p different permutations of models possible given there are p number of variables

ALGO IS GREEDY, its going to find some kind of relationship even if it is redundant or unnecessary variable, 

ofcourse, adjusted r-squared is better
